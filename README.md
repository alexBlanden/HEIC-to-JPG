# HEIC-to-JPG

## Convert HEIC to JPG offline

### About This App

HEIC (High Efficiency Image Container) is a file format primarily used for images and commonly associated with Apple. However, support for this format is limited outside of Apple's ecosystem. While online converters are available, data protection laws and concern about unvetted third-party websites mean they're not always suitable.

With this app, converting your HEIC files to JPEG or PNG is both simple and secure: Drag and drop the folder containing your files, and the conversion process will initiate automatically, and most importantly, locally. The converted files are stored in the same location as the originals. Build the installable application specific to your OS using Electron Builder, inlcuded as a Dev Dependency.
